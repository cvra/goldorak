Asynchronous odometry
=====================

Implements dead-reckoning localisation through odometry for a differential drive robot, assuming encoder information is asynchronous.
Further documentation can be found under the 'doc' folder.

## Assumptions
* Encoder information is asynchronous
* The robot fits a constant acceleration motion model
